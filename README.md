# Flight-Delay-Prediction

The flight delay prediction is done using Random Forest Regressor.

The objective of the project is to perform analysis of the historic flight data to gain valuable insights and build a predictive model to predict whether a flight will be delayed or not given a set of flight characteristics.

The objective of the predictive model is to build a model to predict whether a flight will be delayed or not based on certain characteristics of the flight. Such a model may help both passengers as well as airline companies to predict future delays and minimize them.

**The output whether the flight is delayed or not depends on the time; if the flight is late by 15 minutes or more then it is declared as delayed.**

**Technologies Used:**
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Sklearn
6. Random Forest Regressor from Sklearn
7. Gradient Boosting Regressor from Sklearn

**Web App:**

The .py file contains code for the web app Flight Delay Prediction. For that we have used streamlit which is open-source python library.
